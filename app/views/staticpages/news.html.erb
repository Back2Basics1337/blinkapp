<h2>The Version 0.161.1686 is now available</h2>

<p>Long time since the last update. Due mainly to lot of personal duty for the team members.</p>
<p>Anyway this version mainly introduces more complex layer operations (which is the most requested features from the community).</p>

<p>Please note that this is the last release before a discount update which will occur in one week from this post. So if you are still undecided for Black Ink make your decision before the end of the next week, or it will cost you few more bucks ;)</p>

<p>Many thanks to all the users who already purchased Black Ink! The community grows brb every day and we are really amazed by your great feedback on our product.</p>
